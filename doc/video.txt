Notes from Blake McBride (blake@mcbridemail.com)
Video support under Linux & Mac OS/X has been restored.  Getting it to
work under Windows would probably be easy (given ncurses support).
See the makefile's for instructions on enabling or disabling video
support.
When a file is being edited, you can execute: 5,7:w$$ to enter video
mode (the $ is the escape key).  The "5" means 5 scroll lines at the
bottom of the screen.  The remaining screen space is for the video
display.
Video mode can be exited with:  0,7:w$$
As shown below, you can also startup in video mode using:
      teco -scroll:5  myfile.txt

Original notes
Command line 
------- ----
-NOPAGE	
	Don't separate input into pages.  Instead, treat form feeds
	as normal characters.
+nnn 
	where nnn is any number of digits. Go to line number nnn and
	set NOPAGE. Note this uses the UNIX end of line convention
	for use with cc output &c. The non-unix line termination will
	still be used for nL and other intrinsic TECO commands, this just
	controls the starting line AT INVOCATION.
-SCROLL:nnn	
	do nnn,7:w
-SCROLL:nnn:SEEALL
	do nnn,7:W and 1,3:W
-INSPECT
	Same as /INSPECT
-NOMEMORY
	Same as /NOMEMORY
Video
-----
^W	Immediate mode command - try to place line containing dot in
	centre of scope window
-4W	Complete redraw of screen
-1W	Stop refreshing scope before each prompt
1W	Start refreshing scope before each prompt
0W	refresh scope
3:w	Seeall Mode (set to 1 if SeeAll is on, 0 otherwise)
	seeall is more unix style then you might expect
5:w	Hold mode is not properly implemented. I don't like it anyway.
7:W	Number of lines in command window. The size of the scope window
	will be (Rows - 7:W (- 1 if ET&256))
8:w	Attribute for special characters. This is highly implementation
	dependent (curses implementation dependent). Under SUN OS 4.1
		0	- no marking
		1	- underline
		2	- reverse
		4	- blink
		8	- dim
		16	- bold
		128 	- ALT_CHARSET
	currently controls marking of 	<CR> 			`
				      	END OF PAGE  		(BTEE/+)
9:W	Bit 0 - keypad support on
	Bit 1 - do not do timeout escape sequence detection
ET&1	image mode - doesn't really do much with curses version
ET&2	use scope for delete and control-U
ET&4	accept lowercase input
ET&32	read with no wait on control-T (unimplemented - easy though)
ET&2048	reverse roles of BS and DEL (good if you use stty erase ^H,
	in particular the key placement of BS is sometimes much easier
	to get at then DEL). Should I have it detect the kill character
	and automatically set this?
ET&8192	accept ` as escape (for VT220 terminals)
ET&16384 special VT200 mode
ET&32768 trap control-C
EZ&1	if false VMS style versioning for backup files (multiple backups)
	if true  only one backup level (foo, foo.bak)
EZ&8	if TRUE use LARROW (<) for CR, if false use `
EZ&16	if set then prefer audio beep else visual flash
EZ&32	winline divider for scope
EZ&128	if set DO NOT stop read on FF otherwise make pages as usual
EZ&256	UNIX NL-convert LF to <CR><LF> on input and invert on output
ED&512	controls scope display. If set will use VT100 line drawing
	characters for CR and LF (in non-scope mode). May degrade
	performance.
EZ&2048 if set use BTEE for end of buffer, else use DIAMOND
	(desirable for pathological terminal types)
EZ&8192	don't show CR in scope - closer to TECO-11,  but really
	not as good in my opinion (Mark Henderson)
